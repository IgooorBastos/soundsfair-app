## Introduction: Why Storing Value Matters

You work hard for your money. You save for the future, for your children's education, for retirement, for emergencies. But what if the money you're saving is silently losing value every single day?

This is not a hypothetical scenario—it's the reality for billions of people worldwide living under fiat monetary systems. While you sleep, while you work, while you save, the purchasing power of your currency erodes through a process called **inflation**.

In this lesson, you'll discover why Bitcoin has emerged as one of the most compelling stores of value in human history, how it protects against inflation, and why understanding these concepts is crucial for your financial future.

**What you'll learn:**
- What makes a good store of value
- How inflation silently steals your wealth
- Why Bitcoin's fixed supply creates scarcity
- The concept of "digital gold"
- Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) as a strategy
- Real-world examples of Bitcoin preserving wealth

## Section 1: What is a Store of Value?

### The Three Functions of Money

Throughout history, money has served three primary functions:

1. **Medium of Exchange** - You use it to buy goods and services
2. **Unit of Account** - You measure value in it (prices are quoted in dollars, euros, etc.)
3. **Store of Value** - You can save it today and use it tomorrow without significant loss of purchasing power

For money to be an effective **store of value**, it must maintain its purchasing power over time. This means that the bread you can buy today with $5 should cost roughly the same amount next year, next decade, and beyond.

### Historical Stores of Value

Humans have experimented with many stores of value:

**Gold** (thousands of years)
- Scarce (limited supply on Earth)
- Durable (doesn't rust or decay)
- Divisible (can be melted and divided)
- Portable (relatively, but heavy in large amounts)
- Recognized globally

**Real Estate** (centuries)
- Limited supply (especially in desirable locations)
- Provides utility (shelter)
- Difficult to confiscate
- But: illiquid, expensive to maintain, geographically constrained

**Art & Collectibles** (centuries)
- Unique pieces have scarcity
- Cultural value
- But: subjective valuation, illiquid, difficult to authenticate

**Fiat Currency** (decades)
- Convenient for transactions
- Legal tender (forced acceptance)
- But: **TERRIBLE** store of value due to unlimited supply

### What Makes a Good Store of Value?

A superior store of value possesses these characteristics:

1. **Scarcity** - Limited supply that cannot be arbitrarily increased
2. **Durability** - Doesn't degrade, rust, or decay over time
3. **Portability** - Can be transported or transmitted easily
4. **Divisibility** - Can be broken into smaller units without losing value
5. **Verifiability** - Can be authenticated as genuine
6. **Fungibility** - Each unit is interchangeable with another
7. **Censorship Resistance** - Difficult for third parties to confiscate or freeze

**Exercise:** Before reading further, rank Gold, Real Estate, and Cash (dollars/euros) on each of these seven characteristics on a scale of 1-10. We'll compare your answers with Bitcoin later.

## Section 2: The Silent Theft - Understanding Inflation

### What is Inflation?

**Inflation** is the decrease in purchasing power of money over time, typically measured as the percentage increase in prices of goods and services.

When your government says "inflation was 3% this year," it means:
- Your $100 now buys what $97 bought last year
- You've lost 3% of your purchasing power
- Your savings in cash are worth 3% less

### The Fiat Money Printing Machine

Modern fiat currencies are **not** backed by gold, silver, or any physical commodity. They're backed only by:
- Government decree (legal tender laws)
- Faith and trust in institutions
- The promise that the government won't print too much

But here's the problem: **governments have unlimited ability to print money**, and they use it regularly:

**Recent Money Printing (U.S. M2 Money Supply):**
- 2000: ~$4.6 trillion
- 2010: ~$8.7 trillion (+89%)
- 2020: ~$15.4 trillion (+77%)
- 2021: ~$20.3 trillion (+32% in ONE YEAR)
- 2023: ~$21 trillion

> "In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value." — Alan Greenspan, Former Federal Reserve Chairman (before becoming Fed Chairman)

### The Cantillon Effect: Who Benefits from Inflation?

Not everyone suffers equally from inflation. Those closest to the money printer benefit most:

**Winners:**
1. **Governments** - Can spend newly printed money first, at current prices
2. **Large Banks** - Receive newly created money first, can lend it at profit
3. **Asset Owners** - Stocks, real estate, bonds inflate in price
4. **Debtors** - Pay back loans with devalued currency

**Losers:**
1. **Savers** - Cash savings lose purchasing power
2. **Fixed-income workers** - Salaries don't keep pace with inflation
3. **The poor** - No assets to inflate, spend most income on basics
4. **Retirees** - Fixed pensions buy less each year

This is called the **Cantillon Effect** (named after 18th-century economist Richard Cantillon): New money benefits those who receive it first, at the expense of those who receive it last.

### Real-World Examples of Purchasing Power Loss

**United States (1950-2023):**
- $1 in 1950 → $0.09 purchasing power today (91% loss)
- Average home: $7,354 (1950) → $436,800 (2023)
- Harvard tuition: $600/year (1950) → $52,000/year (2023)
- Loaf of bread: $0.14 (1950) → $2.50 (2023)

**Your lifetime:**
If you were born in 2000 with $10,000 saved:
- That $10,000 has the purchasing power of ~$6,500 in 2000 dollars today
- You've lost ~35% of your wealth by simply holding cash

**Hyperinflation Examples:**
- **Zimbabwe (2008):** 89.7 sextillion percent inflation — money became worthless
- **Venezuela (2018):** 1,000,000% inflation — savings wiped out
- **Weimar Germany (1923):** Wheelbarrows of cash to buy bread

### The 2% Target: A Feature, Not a Bug

Central banks openly target 2% annual inflation. They frame this as "healthy" and "necessary for growth."

But let's do the math:
- 2% inflation annually = 50% loss of purchasing power every 35 years
- Your $100,000 saved today → Worth $50,000 in purchasing power in 2058
- Over a 40-year career: Your savings lose ~55% of their value

**Why 2%?**
Official reasoning: Encourages spending (who wants to hold depreciating cash?) and makes debt cheaper for governments.

**Actual effect:** Silent confiscation of wealth from savers to debtors (primarily governments).

## Section 3: Bitcoin's Fixed Supply - True Digital Scarcity

### The 21 Million Hard Cap

Bitcoin's most revolutionary feature is its **absolutely fixed supply**: **21 million bitcoins will ever exist**. Not 21 million and one. Not "approximately 21 million." Exactly 21,000,000 BTC.

This is enforced by:
1. **Code** - The Bitcoin protocol mathematically limits supply
2. **Consensus** - All network participants verify this rule
3. **Economic incentives** - Miners, nodes, and users protect this property

**No one can change this.** Not Satoshi Nakamoto (Bitcoin's creator, who disappeared). Not miners. Not governments. Not corporations. Not even if 99% of people wanted to—because the 1% would continue the 21M chain.

### The Halving Schedule

New bitcoins are created through mining (we covered this in Level 3). The mining reward **halves approximately every 4 years**:

- **2009-2012:** 50 BTC per block (~7,200 BTC/day)
- **2013-2016:** 25 BTC per block (~3,600 BTC/day)
- **2017-2020:** 12.5 BTC per block (~1,800 BTC/day)
- **2021-2024:** 6.25 BTC per block (~900 BTC/day)
- **2025-2028:** 3.125 BTC per block (~450 BTC/day)
- **2140:** Final bitcoin mined → 0 new BTC forever

**Currently:** ~19.6 million BTC have been mined (93% of total supply)
**Remaining:** ~1.4 million BTC to be mined over next 116 years

### Stock-to-Flow: Measuring Scarcity

**Stock-to-Flow (S2F) ratio** = Existing Supply / Annual New Production

This measures how "hard" (scarce) an asset is:

**Global Commodities:**
- Silver: S2F ~22 (22 years of production to match current stock)
- Gold: S2F ~62 (most scarce physical commodity)
- Copper, Oil, Wheat: S2F <1 (easily producible)

**Bitcoin:**
- 2020: S2F ~25
- 2024: S2F ~56
- 2028: S2F ~113
- 2140: S2F = ∞ (infinite, no new production)

**Bitcoin becomes the scarcest asset in human history.**

### Why Fixed Supply Matters

In fiat:
- Government needs money → Print more
- Economic crisis → Print more
- War, pandemic, bailouts → Print more
- Political promises → Print more

**Result:** Your share of total supply decreases. Your purchasing power declines.

In Bitcoin:
- Crisis → Cannot print more
- War → Cannot print more
- Demand increases → Cannot print more
- **Your 1 BTC remains 1/21,000,000 of all BTC forever**

**Example:**
- Own 1 BTC = You own 0.00000476% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist
- Own $1,000 in USD = Your % of total dollars? Unknown, and shrinking

### Lost Bitcoins: Even More Scarce

Estimated **3-4 million BTC are permanently lost**:
- Lost private keys
- Deaths without backups
- Sent to wrong addresses
- Early miners who threw away hard drives (ouch)

**Effective supply:** Closer to 17-18 million BTC, making each remaining bitcoin even more scarce.

> "Bitcoin's supply is fixed. Demand is variable. Price will reflect this reality." — Plan B, Analyst

## Section 4: Bitcoin as "Digital Gold"

### Gold's 5,000-Year Track Record

Gold has been humanity's store of value for millennia because:
- ✅ Scarce (difficult to mine)
- ✅ Durable (doesn't rust)
- ✅ Divisible (can be melted)
- ✅ Verifiable (can be tested)
- ✅ Fungible (one ounce = another ounce)
- ✅ Globally recognized

But gold has weaknesses:
- ❌ Heavy (hard to transport)
- ❌ Difficult to verify (requires expertise/equipment)
- ❌ Can be confiscated (Executive Order 6102, 1933)
- ❌ Not programmable (can't send gold over internet)
- ❌ Unknown total supply (more could be mined, asteroids contain gold)

### Bitcoin: All of Gold's Strengths, None of Its Weaknesses

Let's revisit our store of value characteristics, now including Bitcoin:

| Property | Gold | Real Estate | Cash | **Bitcoin** |
|----------|------|-------------|------|-------------|
| Scarcity | 8/10 | 7/10 | 1/10 | **10/10** |
| Durability | 10/10 | 6/10 | 5/10 | **10/10** |
| Portability | 4/10 | 1/10 | 7/10 | **10/10** |
| Divisibility | 7/10 | 2/10 | 8/10 | **10/10** |
| Verifiability | 6/10 | 5/10 | 7/10 | **10/10** |
| Fungibility | 9/10 | 3/10 | 9/10 | **9/10** |
| Censorship Resistance | 6/10 | 3/10 | 2/10 | **10/10** |

**Bitcoin scores higher than any historical store of value on nearly every dimension.**

### Why "Digital Gold"?

- **Scarce** - 21M hard cap (gold's supply is unknown)
- **Durable** - Information can't decay (gold doesn't rust)
- **Portable** - Send anywhere instantly (gold is heavy)
- **Divisible** - 1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC (gold requires melting)
- **Verifiable** - Cryptographically provable (gold requires testing)
- **Unseizable** - Memorize 12 words, cross any border (gold can be confiscated)

**Gold market cap:** ~$13 trillion
**Bitcoin market cap:** ~$850 billion (as of late 2023)

If Bitcoin reaches "digital gold" status (just matching gold's value):
- Bitcoin price: ~$650,000 per BTC
- Current price: ~$43,000
- **Potential upside: ~15x**

This doesn't mean it will happen—but it illustrates Bitcoin's asymmetric risk/reward as a store of value.

> "Bitcoin is a remarkable cryptographic achievement, and the ability to create something that is not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value." — Eric Schmidt, Former Google CEO

## Section 5: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) - A Practical Strategy

### What is DCA?

**Dollar-Cost Averaging** means investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price.

Instead of:
- Trying to "time the market" (buy low, sell high)
- Investing a lump sum all at once
- Waiting for the "perfect moment"

You simply:
- Buy $50, $100, or $500 worth every week/month
- Automate the process
- Ignore short-term price swings
- Focus on long-term accumulation

### Why DCA Works

**Problem with lump sum investing:**
- What if you buy at the peak? (Bad timing)
- What if price drops 50% next week? (Regret, panic selling)
- Psychological pressure to "get it right"

**DCA benefits:**
1. **Removes emotion** - No guessing, no timing, just consistency
2. **Averages out volatility** - Buy high, buy low, average cost smooths out
3. **Reduces regret** - Didn't invest life savings at peak
4. **Compounds discipline** - Builds wealth steadily over time

### Historical DCA Performance

**Example: $100/month DCA into Bitcoin**

Starting in **January 2015** ($220/BTC):
- Total invested: $10,800 (108 months × $100)
- BTC accumulated: ~4.2 BTC
- Value in December 2023: ~$180,600
- **Return: +1,572%**

Starting in **January 2018** (near peak, $13,800/BTC):
- Total invested: $7,200 (72 months × $100)
- BTC accumulated: ~0.52 BTC
- Value in December 2023: ~$22,360
- **Return: +210%** (even buying near the top!)

Starting in **January 2021** ($32,000/BTC):
- Total invested: $3,600 (36 months × $100)
- BTC accumulated: ~0.12 BTC
- Value in December 2023: ~$5,160
- **Return: +43%**

**Key insight:** DCA has been profitable over EVERY 4-year period in Bitcoin's history, regardless of starting point.

### DCA vs Lump Sum vs Timing

**Scenario:** You have $10,000 to invest

**Strategy 1: Lump Sum (All at once)**
- Risk: High (could buy at peak)
- Reward: High (if you time it perfectly)
- Stress: Maximum

**Strategy 2: Timing the Market**
- Risk: You'll probably fail (95% of professional traders fail)
- Reward: Unpredictable
- Stress: Extreme

**Strategy 3: DCA ($200/month for 50 months)**
- Risk: Low (averaged over time)
- Reward: Historically very good in Bitcoin
- Stress: Minimal

> "Time in the market beats timing the market." — Investment Wisdom

### How to Start DCA

1. **Decide your amount** - What can you afford monthly without stress? ($25, $50, $100, $500?)
2. **Choose your interval** - Weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly
3. **Automate it** - Use exchange auto-buy features or set calendar reminders
4. **Stay consistent** - Don't skip months or try to "time" purchases
5. **Extend your horizon** - Think 4+ years minimum
6. **Self-custody** - Withdraw to your own wallet regularly (not your keys, not your coins)

## Section 6: Real-World Examples - Bitcoin Preserving Wealth

### Case Study: Argentina (2019-2023)

**Problem:**
- Argentine Peso inflation: ~100%+ annually
- Strict capital controls (can't easily buy dollars)
- Bank freezes and confiscations (history of "corralito")

**Bitcoin Solution:**
- Argentinians buy Bitcoin through P2P markets
- Preserve savings against peso devaluation
- Transfer wealth across borders
- Bypass government restrictions

**Result:**
- Bitcoin adoption in Argentina: Among highest in Latin America
- LocalBitcoins volume: Consistently in top 5 globally
- Bitcoin premium: Often trades 5-10% above global price (high demand)

### Case Study: Lebanon (2019-2023)

**Problem:**
- Banks froze depositor accounts (billions trapped)
- Currency lost 95% of value
- Life savings became worthless overnight

**Bitcoin Solution:**
- Those who held Bitcoin maintained purchasing power
- Could access funds without bank permission
- Sent/received remittances when traditional systems failed

**Quote from Beirut resident:**
> "The banks took everything. My father had $80,000 in the bank—now he can withdraw $200/month maximum, and it's worth nothing. My Bitcoin nobody can touch."

### Case Study: Nigerian Frozen Accounts (2021)

**Problem:**
- Government froze bank accounts of #EndSARS protesters
- Centralized payment processors blocked donations

**Bitcoin Solution:**
- Protest organizers switched to Bitcoin
- Received $400,000+ in BTC donations
- Government couldn't freeze Bitcoin addresses
- Demonstrators received funds despite ban

**Outcome:** Demonstrated Bitcoin's censorship resistance in real-world activism.

### Case Study: Long-Term Holders (HODLers)

**Early Bitcoin Buyers:**
- Pizza purchase (2010): 10,000 BTC for 2 pizzas (now worth ~$430 million)
- Silk Road seizure (2013): Government sold 30,000 BTC for $18M (now worth ~$1.3 billion)
- Hodlers who bought in 2011 at $1: 43,000x return ($1 → $43,000)

**Even recent holders:**
- March 2020 COVID crash: BTC ~$4,000
- December 2023: BTC ~$43,000
- **3.75-year return: +975%**

Compare to:
- S&P 500 (same period): +58%
- Gold: +40%
- Real Estate: +25%
- Cash: -15% (due to inflation)

---

## Section 7: Risks and Considerations

### Bitcoin's Volatility

Bitcoin's price is **highly volatile**:
- Daily swings: 5-15% common
- Annual crashes: 70-80% drawdowns have occurred
- Recovery time: 2-4 years historically

**Why volatile?**
- Relatively small market cap (compared to gold, stocks)
- 24/7 global market (never closes)
- Speculative investors (not all holders are long-term)
- Nascent technology (still being adopted)

**How to handle volatility:**
- ✅ **Long time horizon** (4+ years minimum)
- ✅ **DCA strategy** (smooths out swings)
- ✅ **Only invest what you can afford to lose**
- ✅ **Understand the fundamentals** (don't panic sell)
- ❌ Don't check price every day
- ❌ Don't invest rent money or emergency fund

### Regulatory Uncertainty

Governments are still figuring out how to regulate Bitcoin:
- Some countries embrace it (El Salvador, Switzerland)
- Some ban it (China, Algeria)
- Most are ambiguous (U.S., EU evolving)

**Risk:** Regulations could impact price, usage, or access

**Mitigation:** Bitcoin is global and censorship-resistant. Even in countries with bans, P2P trading continues.

### Technology Risk

Bitcoin requires:
- Internet connectivity
- Electricity
- Technical knowledge (wallets, keys, security)

**Risks:**
- Losing private keys = losing Bitcoin forever
- Sending to wrong address = funds gone
- Hacks, scams, phishing attacks

**Mitigation:**
- Education (that's why you're here!)
- Hardware wallets for large amounts
- Backup seed phrases securely
- Practice with small amounts first

### Not a Get-Rich-Quick Scheme

Bitcoin is:
- ✅ A long-term store of value
- ✅ Protection against inflation
- ✅ A savings technology

Bitcoin is NOT:
- ❌ Guaranteed profit
- ❌ A way to "get rich quick"
- ❌ Risk-free
- ❌ A replacement for emergency funds

**Realistic expectations:**
- Think 5-10 year horizon
- Expect volatility and drawdowns
- Focus on preserving purchasing power, not "mooning"
- Only allocate a portion of savings (5-10% often recommended)

---

## Conclusion: Bitcoin as a Lifeboat

In a world of:
- Unlimited money printing
- Negative real interest rates
- Currency debasement
- Wealth confiscation
- Capital controls

**Bitcoin offers:**
- Fixed supply (21M)
- Permissionless access
- Global portability
- Unstoppable transactions
- Provable scarcity

It's not perfect. It's volatile, it's new, and it requires education. But for millions of people worldwide facing currency collapse, frozen bank accounts, and eroding purchasing power, **Bitcoin is a lifeboat**.

You don't need to bet your entire net worth on Bitcoin. Even a small allocation—saved consistently over time through DCA—can serve as:
- **Inflation hedge** (preserve purchasing power)
- **Savings technology** (disciplined accumulation)
- **Financial insurance** (against monetary chaos)
- **Opt-out mechanism** (from fiat debasement)

The question isn't "Will Bitcoin go to $100,000 or $1 million?" The question is:

**"Can I afford NOT to have some exposure to the hardest money ever created, as governments continue printing fiat into oblivion?"**

You've now completed Level 5. You understand:
- ✅ What makes a good store of value
- ✅ How inflation silently steals wealth
- ✅ Why Bitcoin's 21M cap creates true scarcity
- ✅ Bitcoin as "digital gold"
- ✅ Dollar-Cost Averaging as a strategy
- ✅ Real-world examples of Bitcoin preserving wealth

**Next:** In Level 6, we'll explore Bitcoin as an Economic Freedom Tool—how it empowers individuals, enables peer-to-peer transactions without permission, and provides financial access to the billions excluded from the traditional banking system.

# Level 5 Quiz

**Instructions:** You need 70% (7/10) to pass. You can retake as many times as needed.

---

### Question 1
What are the three primary functions of money?

A) Saving, investing, and spending
B) Medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value
C) Cash, credit, and crypto
D) Production, distribution, and consumption

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Money serves three functions: (1) Medium of Exchange - used for transactions, (2) Unit of Account - measure of value, (3) Store of Value - preserves purchasing power over time. These are the classic economic definitions of money's roles.

---

### Question 2
What is the maximum number of bitcoins that will ever exist?

A) 21 billion
B) Unlimited, like fiat
C) 21 million
D) 100 million

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Bitcoin's hard cap is exactly 21 million BTC, enforced by code and consensus. This fixed supply is what creates Bitcoin's scarcity and differentiates it from fiat currencies that can be printed without limit.

---

### Question 3
If inflation is 2% per year, how much purchasing power does $100 lose over 35 years?

A) 10%
B) 25%
C) 50%
D) 70%

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** At 2% annual inflation, purchasing power is cut in half approximately every 35 years. Your $100 would have the purchasing power of only $50 in 35 years. This demonstrates the long-term corrosive effect of "low" inflation.

---

### Question 4
What happens to Bitcoin's mining reward approximately every 4 years?

A) It doubles
B) It halves
C) It stays the same
D) It increases by 10%

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Bitcoin undergoes a "halving" every ~210,000 blocks (~4 years), cutting the mining reward in half. This started at 50 BTC per block in 2009, then 25 (2012), 12.5 (2016), 6.25 (2020), 3.125 (2024), etc., until no new Bitcoin is created around 2140.

---

### Question 5
What is the Cantillon Effect?

A) Bitcoin's price volatility
B) Those closest to money creation benefit most from inflation
C) The effect of halvings on supply
D) A type of mining algorithm

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The Cantillon Effect (named after economist Richard Cantillon) describes how those who receive newly printed money first benefit at the expense of those who receive it last. Governments, banks, and asset owners benefit, while savers and fixed-income workers lose.

---

### Question 6
What does "DCA" stand for and what does it mean?

A) Dollar Cost Analysis - analyzing Bitcoin's price
B) Digital Currency Acquisition - buying any crypto
C) Dollar Cost Averaging - investing fixed amounts regularly
D) Decentralized Coin Allocation - distributing Bitcoin

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) means investing a fixed dollar amount at regular intervals (weekly, monthly) regardless of price. This removes emotion, averages out volatility, and has historically worked well for Bitcoin over 4+ year periods.

---

### Question 7
What is Bitcoin's Stock-to-Flow (S2F) ratio after the 2024 halving?

A) Less than gold's (~62)
B) About the same as gold's
C) Significantly higher than gold's
D) Impossible to calculate

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** After the 2024 halving, Bitcoin's S2F ratio is ~56, close to gold's ~62. After the 2028 halving, it will be ~113, and by 2140 it will be infinite (no new production). Bitcoin becomes the scarcest asset in human history.

---

### Question 8
Why do some call Bitcoin "digital gold"?

A) It's yellow in color
B) It has all of gold's strengths but fewer weaknesses
C) It's backed by gold reserves
D) It's only for wealthy people

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Bitcoin is called "digital gold" because it shares gold's key properties (scarce, durable, divisible, verifiable, fungible) but improves on gold's weaknesses (Bitcoin is more portable, easier to verify, unseizable, and has a known fixed supply). It's gold upgraded for the digital age.

---

### Question 9
According to the lesson, has DCA into Bitcoin been profitable over EVERY 4-year period in its history?

A) Yes
B) No
C) Only if you started before 2015
D) Only during bull markets

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:** Historically, DCA into Bitcoin has been profitable over every 4-year period, regardless of starting point. Even starting near 2017's peak (~$20k), 4 years of DCA resulted in profits. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, but this pattern has held so far.

---

### Question 10
What is the most important consideration when investing in Bitcoin as a store of value?

A) Day-trading to maximize short-term gains
B) Long time horizon (4+ years) and only investing what you can afford to lose
C) Checking the price every day
D) Investing your entire net worth immediately

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Bitcoin's volatility requires a long time horizon (4+ years minimum) to weather drawdowns. You should only invest money you can afford to lose or not access for years. This isn't day-trading or gambling—it's a long-term savings/inflation hedge strategy. Never invest emergency funds or money needed soon.
