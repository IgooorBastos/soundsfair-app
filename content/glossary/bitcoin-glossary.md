# Bitcoin Glossary - 50 Essential Terms

A comprehensive guide to Bitcoin terminology for beginners through advanced users.

---

## A

### Address
A string of alphanumeric characters (beginning with 1, 3, or bc1) representing a destination for a Bitcoin payment. Like an email address for Bitcoin, but each address should ideally be used only once for privacy. Example: `bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh`

**Related terms:** Public key, Private key, Wallet

---

### Altcoin
Any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. Short for "alternative coin." Examples include Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP. While some have innovative features, most lack Bitcoin's decentralization, security, and network effects.

**Related terms:** Shitcoin, Cryptocurrency

---

## B

### Bitcoin (uppercase B)
The Bitcoin network, protocol, and ecosystem as a whole. Example: "Bitcoin is a decentralized monetary network."

**Compare to:** bitcoin (lowercase b)

---

### bitcoin (lowercase b)
The unit of currency (also abbreviated BTC). Example: "I own 0.5 bitcoin."

**Compare to:** Bitcoin (uppercase B)

---

### Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)
A design document providing information to the Bitcoin community or describing a new feature for Bitcoin. BIPs are the primary mechanism for proposing changes to Bitcoin. Example: BIP-39 standardized seed phrases.

**Related terms:** Soft fork, Hard fork

---

### Block
A collection of Bitcoin transactions bundled together and added to the blockchain approximately every 10 minutes. Each block contains a reference to the previous block, creating an immutable chain.

**Related terms:** Blockchain, Mining, Block height

---

### Block Height
The number of blocks preceding a particular block in the blockchain. The genesis block (first block) has height 0. Current block height (2024) is ~820,000.

**Related terms:** Block, Blockchain

---

### Blockchain
A chronological, immutable database of all Bitcoin transactions, stored across thousands of nodes globally. Each "block" of transactions is cryptographically linked to the previous one, creating a "chain" that cannot be altered without redoing all subsequent work.

**Related terms:** Block, Distributed ledger, Node

---

### BTC
The ticker symbol and abbreviation for bitcoin, the currency unit. 1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis.

**Related terms:** Satoshi, bitcoin

---

## C

### Cantillon Effect
An economic concept describing how those closest to money creation benefit most from inflation, while those furthest away (savers, workers) suffer most. Named after 18th-century economist Richard Cantillon. Bitcoin eliminates this by having no "money printer."

**Related terms:** Inflation, Fiat currency

---

### CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency)
Government-issued digital currency (e.g., Digital Yuan, Digital Dollar). Unlike Bitcoin, CBDCs are centralized, programmable, and allow total surveillance. They're fiat's counter-response to Bitcoin.

**Related terms:** Fiat currency, Bitcoin

---

### Cold Storage
Storing Bitcoin private keys completely offline (hardware wallets, paper wallets, metal backups), making them immune to online hacking. Recommended for large holdings or long-term savings.

**Related terms:** Hot wallet, Hardware wallet, Self-custody

---

### Consensus
Agreement among Bitcoin nodes on the state of the blockchain. Bitcoin achieves consensus through proof-of-work, ensuring all participants agree on transaction history without trusting any central authority.

**Related terms:** Proof-of-work, Node, Mining

---

### Cryptography
The mathematical science of encoding and decoding information. Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography (ECDSA) to secure transactions and prove ownership without revealing private keys.

**Related terms:** Private key, Public key, Hash function

---

## D

### DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)
An investment strategy where you buy a fixed dollar amount of Bitcoin at regular intervals (e.g., $100/week) regardless of price. Removes emotion, averages out volatility, and has been profitable over every 4-year Bitcoin cycle.

**Related terms:** HODL, Stacking sats

---

### Decentralization
Distribution of control across many participants rather than one central authority. Bitcoin is decentralized across ~15,000 nodes globally, making it resistant to censorship, shutdown, or control by any single entity.

**Related terms:** Node, Peer-to-peer, Consensus

---

### Difficulty Adjustment
Bitcoin automatically adjusts mining difficulty every 2,016 blocks (~2 weeks) to maintain the 10-minute average block time, regardless of total hash rate. This ensures predictable issuance and security.

**Related terms:** Mining, Hash rate, Proof-of-work

---

## F

### Fiat Currency
Government-issued money not backed by physical commodities (gold, silver). Derives value from legal tender laws and trust in government. Examples: US Dollar, Euro, Yen. Has unlimited supply and loses purchasing power over time through inflation.

**Related terms:** Inflation, Hard money, Cantillon Effect

---

### Fork
A divergence in the blockchain when the protocol rules change. **Soft fork:** Backward-compatible upgrade (e.g., SegWit). **Hard fork:** Non-compatible change creating a new chain (e.g., Bitcoin Cash split in 2017).

**Related terms:** Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, Consensus

---

## G

### Genesis Block
The first block in the Bitcoin blockchain, mined by Satoshi Nakamoto on January 3, 2009. Contains the message: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"—a reference to the financial crisis motivating Bitcoin's creation.

**Related terms:** Block, Satoshi Nakamoto, Blockchain

---

## H

### Halving
An event occurring every 210,000 blocks (~4 years) where the Bitcoin mining reward is cut in half. Started at 50 BTC/block (2009), currently 3.125 BTC/block (2024), will reach ~0 by 2140. This enforces Bitcoin's 21M supply cap and increasing scarcity.

**Related terms:** Mining, Supply cap, Stock-to-flow

---

### Hard Money
Money that is difficult or impossible to increase in supply. Historically gold; now Bitcoin. Opposite of fiat which can be printed unlimited. Hard money preserves purchasing power over time.

**Related terms:** Fiat currency, Sound money, Stock-to-flow

---

### Hardware Wallet
A physical device (e.g., Coldcard, Trezor, Ledger) that stores private keys offline, protecting them from online threats. Essential for securing large Bitcoin holdings ($1,000+).

**Related terms:** Cold storage, Self-custody, Private key

---

### Hash
A cryptographic function that converts input data into a fixed-length output (e.g., SHA-256 produces 256-bit hashes). Bitcoin uses hashing for proof-of-work and securing transactions. Hash functions are one-way: easy to compute, impossible to reverse.

**Related terms:** SHA-256, Proof-of-work, Mining

---

### Hash Rate
The total computational power dedicated to Bitcoin mining, measured in hashes per second (H/s). Higher hash rate = more security. Current global hash rate: ~450 EH/s (exahashes/second).

**Related terms:** Mining, Proof-of-work, Difficulty adjustment

---

### HODL
A misspelling of "hold" that became a meme in the Bitcoin community, meaning to hold Bitcoin long-term through volatility rather than selling. Originated from a 2013 BitcoinTalk forum post. Philosophy: "Time in market > timing market."

**Related terms:** DCA, Stacking sats, Diamond hands

---

### Hot Wallet
A Bitcoin wallet connected to the internet (mobile apps, desktop software, web wallets). Convenient for daily transactions but less secure than cold storage. Recommended for small amounts only (<$500-$1,000).

**Related terms:** Cold storage, Wallet, Self-custody

---

## I

### Inflation
Decrease in purchasing power of money over time, typically due to increased money supply. Fiat currencies inflate 2-7% annually (official: 2%, real: higher). Bitcoin has **zero supply inflation** after all 21M are mined, and **decreasing issuance** until then.

**Related terms:** Fiat currency, Cantillon Effect, Hard money

---

## K

### KYC (Know Your Customer)
Regulations requiring businesses (exchanges) to verify customer identity (ID, address, etc.). Provides regulatory compliance but reduces privacy. Some Bitcoin users prefer P2P exchanges (Bisq, RoboSats) to avoid KYC.

**Related terms:** AML, Privacy, P2P

---

## L

### Lightning Network
A "Layer 2" payment protocol built on top of Bitcoin, enabling instant, low-fee transactions by conducting most activity off-chain and settling on the Bitcoin blockchain later. Solves Bitcoin's scalability challenges for everyday payments.

**Related terms:** Satoshi, Layer 2, Scalability

---

## M

### Mempool
The "memory pool" where unconfirmed transactions wait before miners include them in blocks. Higher fee transactions are prioritized. You can view mempool status at mempool.space to estimate optimal transaction fees.

**Related terms:** Transaction fee, Mining, Block

---

### Mining
The process of solving complex mathematical puzzles (proof-of-work) to add new blocks to the blockchain and secure the network. Miners are rewarded with newly minted bitcoin (block subsidy) plus transaction fees. Currently ~3.125 BTC per block (~$140,000 at $45k/BTC).

**Related terms:** Proof-of-work, Hash rate, Halving, ASIC

---

### Multisig (Multi-signature)
A Bitcoin address requiring multiple private keys to authorize a transaction (e.g., 2-of-3 means any 2 of 3 keys can spend). Enhances security and enables collaborative custody (e.g., you + family + lawyer). Recommended for large holdings or inheritance planning.

**Related terms:** Private key, Cold storage, Security

---

## N

### Node
A computer running Bitcoin software that validates and relays transactions/blocks. ~15,000 reachable nodes globally enforce Bitcoin's rules (21M cap, transaction validity). Running a node lets you verify transactions trustlessly ("Don't trust, verify").

**Related terms:** Full node, Decentralization, Consensus

---

### Nonce
A number miners increment while attempting to find a valid block hash. Part of the proof-of-work process. Miners try billions/trillions of nonces per second until finding one that produces a hash meeting difficulty requirements.

**Related terms:** Mining, Proof-of-work, Hash

---

## P

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
Direct interaction between participants without intermediaries. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system—you send bitcoin directly to another person without banks, payment processors, or other gatekeepers.

**Related terms:** Decentralization, Permissionless, Bisq

---

### Permissionless
The property that anyone can use Bitcoin without needing approval from any authority. No ID, no bank account, no credit check—just internet access and a private key. This enables financial inclusion for the unbanked and resistance to censorship.

**Related terms:** Censorship resistance, Financial freedom, Self-sovereignty

---

### Private Key
A secret 256-bit number that controls your Bitcoin. Anyone with your private key can spend your Bitcoin. NEVER share it. Usually represented as a 12- or 24-word seed phrase for easier backup.

**Related terms:** Public key, Seed phrase, Address, Self-custody

---

### Proof-of-Work (PoW)
Bitcoin's consensus mechanism where miners expend computational energy to solve cryptographic puzzles, proving they invested resources to secure the network. This makes attacking Bitcoin prohibitively expensive. Criticized for energy use but essential for security and decentralization.

**Related terms:** Mining, Hash rate, Consensus, Energy

---

### Public Key
A cryptographic key mathematically derived from your private key. It generates your Bitcoin address. You can share public keys/addresses freely—they allow others to send you bitcoin but can't be used to spend your bitcoin.

**Related terms:** Private key, Address, Cryptography

---

## S

### Satoshi (sat)
The smallest unit of bitcoin. 1 bitcoin = 100,000,000 satoshis. Named after Bitcoin's creator. With Bitcoin's high price, many transactions are denominated in sats. Example: "I spent 50,000 sats on coffee."

**Related terms:** BTC, Stacking sats

---

### Satoshi Nakamoto
The pseudonymous creator(s) of Bitcoin. Published the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008, mined the genesis block in 2009, and disappeared in 2011. Identity remains unknown. Estimated to hold ~1 million BTC (never moved).

**Related terms:** Genesis block, Whitepaper, Decentralization

---

### Seed Phrase
A list of 12 or 24 words that represents your private keys. This phrase can restore your entire Bitcoin wallet on any device. **Critical:** Write it down, never type it, store securely (3-2-1 backup rule). If lost, your Bitcoin is gone forever. If stolen, your Bitcoin is stolen.

**Related terms:** Private key, Recovery phrase, Mnemonic, BIP-39

---

### Self-Custody
Holding your own Bitcoin private keys rather than trusting a third party (exchange, bank). Embodied in the phrase "Not your keys, not your coins." Essential for true ownership and censorship resistance.

**Related terms:** Private key, Cold storage, Hardware wallet

---

### SHA-256
The cryptographic hash function Bitcoin uses for proof-of-work and securing transactions. Produces a 256-bit output from any input. Designed by the NSA, publicly available, and considered secure. Core to Bitcoin's security model.

**Related terms:** Hash, Cryptography, Mining

---

### Shitcoin
A derogatory term for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, especially those considered scams, poorly designed, or centralized. Bitcoin maximalists use this term broadly; others use it for provable scams only.

**Related terms:** Altcoin, Bitcoin maximalism

---

### Sound Money
Money that maintains its value over time, is difficult to inflate, and serves as a reliable store of value. Historically gold; now Bitcoin. Opposite of fiat which loses purchasing power constantly.

**Related terms:** Hard money, Fiat currency, Austrian economics

---

### Stacking Sats
Accumulating satoshis (Bitcoin's smallest unit) regularly over time, typically through DCA. Popular phrase in the Bitcoin community reflecting long-term, disciplined saving. "Stay humble, stack sats."

**Related terms:** Satoshi, DCA, HODL

---

### Stock-to-Flow (S2F)
A scarcity measure: Existing supply / Annual new production. Higher S2F = more scarce. Gold's S2F: ~62. Bitcoin's S2F after 2024 halving: ~56. After 2028 halving: ~113. By 2140: ∞ (no new production). Controversial as a price model but useful for understanding scarcity.

**Related terms:** Halving, Scarcity, Hard money

---

## T

### Taproot
A 2021 Bitcoin upgrade (activated Nov 2021) improving privacy, efficiency, and smart contract capabilities. Makes complex transactions (multisig, Lightning) look like regular transactions, enhancing fungibility and privacy.

**Related terms:** Soft fork, BIP, SegWit

---

### Transaction Fee
A fee paid to miners for including your transaction in a block. Measured in satoshis per byte (sat/vB). Higher fee = faster confirmation. Current fees: $1-10 depending on network congestion. Lightning Network offers near-zero fees.

**Related terms:** Mempool, Mining, Satoshi

---

### Trustless
The property that Bitcoin works without requiring trust in any party. You verify transactions cryptographically rather than trusting banks or governments. "Don't trust, verify" is a core Bitcoin principle.

**Related terms:** Decentralization, Node, Proof-of-work

---

## U

### UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)
Bitcoin's accounting model. Each UTXO represents a discrete chunk of bitcoin that can be spent. Your wallet balance is the sum of all UTXOs you control. Contrast with account-based models (Ethereum, traditional banks).

**Related terms:** Transaction, Address, Wallet

---

## V

### Volatility
Large price swings common in Bitcoin. Annual volatility: 50-100%. Historical crashes: 70-85%. Caused by relatively small market cap, 24/7 trading, speculation, and nascent adoption. Expected to decrease as market matures. Long-term holders tolerate volatility for asymmetric upside.

**Related terms:** HODL, DCA, Bear market

---

## W

### Wallet
Software or hardware that manages your private keys and allows you to send/receive Bitcoin. Types: Mobile wallets (hot), hardware wallets (cold), paper wallets, multisig. **Critical:** The wallet doesn't "store" Bitcoin (that's on the blockchain)—it stores keys.

**Related terms:** Private key, Seed phrase, Address, Self-custody

---

### Whitepaper
"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" by Satoshi Nakamoto (October 31, 2008). A 9-page document outlining Bitcoin's design and vision. Available at bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf. Essential reading for understanding Bitcoin's purpose.

**Related terms:** Satoshi Nakamoto, Genesis block

---

## Additional Important Terms

### 21 Million
Bitcoin's hard supply cap. Exactly 21,000,000 BTC will ever exist, enforced by code and consensus. Currently ~19.6M mined (~93%). Final bitcoin will be mined around 2140. This absolute scarcity is Bitcoin's defining characteristic.

**Related terms:** Halving, Scarcity, Stock-to-flow

---

### 51% Attack
A theoretical attack where an entity controlling >50% of Bitcoin's hash rate could rewrite recent transaction history. Prohibitively expensive (~$20+ billion in hardware + ongoing electricity costs) and would destroy Bitcoin's value (and attacker's investment). Never successfully executed on Bitcoin.

**Related terms:** Hash rate, Mining, Security

---

### Austrian Economics
A school of economic thought emphasizing sound money, free markets, and individual choice. Influential in Bitcoin community. Key figures: Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, Murray Rothbard. Principles: Time preference, marginal utility, subjection valuation.

**Related terms:** Sound money, Hard money, Libertarianism

---

### Diamond Hands
A term (from investing culture) meaning strong conviction to hold Bitcoin through volatility without panic selling. Opposite: "Paper hands" (panic sellers). Related to HODL culture.

**Related terms:** HODL, Volatility, FUD

---

### FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt)
Negative information or misinformation spread about Bitcoin (often by those with vested interests in fiat system). Common FUD: "Bitcoin is for criminals," "Bitcoin wastes energy," "Bitcoin is a bubble." Often refuted by research and data.

**Related terms:** HODL, Diamond hands, Censorship resistance

---

### Time Preference
An economic concept: Do you prefer goods now or later? **Low time preference:** Delay gratification, save for future (Bitcoin incentivizes this). **High time preference:** Consume now (fiat inflation incentivizes this). Sound money lowers time preference, enabling long-term thinking and capital accumulation.

**Related terms:** Austrian economics, Hard money, DCA
